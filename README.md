### The Game Project [YEAR 1 COMPUTER SCIENCE]

[BACKGROUND] This is an interactive game using P5.js. This is the first game I created without any prior knowledge of coding. We first modelled our character, scenery, collectable items all from shapes.

[HOW TO PLAY]

Use the LEFT and RIGHT keys on your keyboard to move accordingly. Use SPACE to jump.

The player must collect coins to survive and raise the flag, so their teammates know that the collection is complete. The player has three lives as shown by the hearts on the top of the screen. The player must avoid the enemies and canyons and collect more coins until they reach the end goal flag!!
